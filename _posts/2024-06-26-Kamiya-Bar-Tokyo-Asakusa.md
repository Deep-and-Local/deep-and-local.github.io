## Shop Infomation
<p class="site-description">
"Founded in the 13th year of the Meiji era (1880), located at 1-1 Asakusa. Japan's first bar, beloved by many literary masters."

> Kamiya Bar is renowned for its special liquor, 'Denki Bran,' a brandy-based cocktail that has been famous since the Meiji era.  A visit to Kamiya Bar isn't complete without trying Denki Bran, available in both standard (ALC. 30%) and classic (ALC. 40%) versions. Denki Bran is not only celebrated for its historical significance but also appears in novels and poetry. The first floor houses the bar, while the second floor features a casual retro-style restaurant where families with children are welcome— and yes, the restaurant also serves Denki Bran.
