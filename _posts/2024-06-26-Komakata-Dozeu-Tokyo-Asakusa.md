## Shop Infomation
'For a little over 200 years since our establishment in 1801, through the continued support from our customers, we have been able to retain the taste of Edo in our "flavors" and "hospitability." Among the many restaurants serving "Japanese cuisine" taht have been around in Asakusa, Tokyo since the Edo period, ours stands out as one of the places that have the longest history.'
