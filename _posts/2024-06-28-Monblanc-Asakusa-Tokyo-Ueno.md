## Shop Infomation
Monblanc is a very delicious restaurant that serves hamburg steaks cooked on an iron plate. To provide customers with the freshest and tastiest experience, we use 100% domestic beef shoulder loin for our handmade hamburg steaks, which are incredibly juicy. Please enjoy our freshly made, piping hot hamburg steaks.

> Are you tired of Japanese traditional foods? Monblanc (not Mont Blanc) is a 'western-style' restaurant particularly popular by local people. To be hornest, the menu is pretty standard. However, you can tell that there is something special about this restaurant once you visit.
