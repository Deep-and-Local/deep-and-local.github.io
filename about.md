# Our Mission
Our goal is to prevent over-tourism issues and improve the experiences of both customers and shop owners in Japan.

It’s not easy for small shops to accept every customer. Particularly when you are not fluent in Japanese and don’t know Japanese culture, some shops are not ready to provide services or products to you. Although they do not mean to discriminate against you, those shops are legally allowed to refuse service when they have valid reasons.

## We Protect Shop Owners
Refusing customers can cause serious business trouble and risk. Our guide aims to prevent this issue by letting visitors know the shop’s availability in advance. We also accumulate and share the problems that occur so that local shops can improve their management.


## We Protect Visitors
Regardless of the reason, if you get refused without knowing why, it can be frustrating. Our guide aims to prevent you from having such a terrible experience in Japan. Additionally, if you feel that you were unjustly treated at a shop you visited, we are here to listen to you.

## And Connect...
Our goal is not to segregate local shops and visitors. We understand that you want to visit places where local people actually spend their time, and we want to assist you in doing so. 
Not all local shops refuse foreign visitors. They want to welcome foreign visitors within their capacity and availability, and we aim to help local shops attract visitors.
